Since 1992, she has been focused on nurturing  Translation/Interpreting Studies at the Ivan Franko University in Lviv. In 1994, Roksolana Zorivchak set up a methodological workshop in Translation/Interpreting Studies and Contrastive Linguistics in memory of  Professor Yuriy Zhluktenko, which subsequently was to contribute to the moulding of Translation/Interpreting Studies in Lviv as a branch of the all-Ukrainian school in the field. In 1996, owing primarily to her efforts, the first students for professional training in English-Ukrainian translation/interpreting were admitted to the Ivan Franko University in Lviv to meet a growing need for such specialists in Ukraine. Professor Zorivchak developed curricula for all major courses and disciplines and it was largely due to her endeavour that the Department of Translation/Interpreting Studies and Contrastive Linguistics bearing the name of Hryhoriy Kochur was inaugurated at the Ivan Franko University in 1998. As a scholarly supervisor of many postgraduate students (14 defended dissertations) and official reviewer of candidate and doctoral dissertations as well as  a member of the councils conferring scholarly degrees at the Taras Shevchenko University in Kyiv (1990-2010) and the Ivan Franko University in Lviv (since 1990) along with the Attestation Committee, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (2009-2010), Professor Zorivchak is making an important contribution to the training of future scholars and the promotion of scholarship and learning  in Ukraine.</p></div></section><section class='section'><h2>Courses</h2><div><ul><li><a href='http://lingua.lnu.edu.ua/en/course/contrastive-phraseology'>Contrastive Phraseology (English-Ukrainian Translation)</a></li><li><a href='http://lingua.lnu.edu.ua/en/course/masters-seminar-5'>Master’s Seminar (English-Ukrainian Translation)</a></li><li><a href='http://lingua.lnu.edu.ua/en/course/pregraduation-seminar-3'>Pregraduation Seminar (English-Ukrainian Translation)</a></li><li><a href='http://lingua.lnu.edu.ua/en/course/actual-problems-of-translation'>Selected Aspects of Philology and Translation</a></li><li><a href='http://lingua.lnu.edu.ua/en/course/sociolinguistics-3'>Sociolinguistics (English-Ukrainian Translation)</a></li><li><a href='http://lingua.lnu.edu.ua/en/course/world-literature-in-ukrainian-translations-3'>World Literature in Ukrainian Translations (English-Ukrainian Translation)</a></li></ul></div></section><section class='section'><h2>Publications</h2><div><p>Publications by R.
